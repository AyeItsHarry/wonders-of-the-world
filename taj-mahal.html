    Standing gracefully on the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, India, the Taj Mahal is a timeless symbol of love and architectural brilliance. Known for its mesmerizing beauty and intricate craftsmanship, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, captivating millions with its elegance and poignant history.
  </p>
  <h3>
    History and Inspiration
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Taj Mahal was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away during childbirth. This breathtaking mausoleum was envisioned as an eternal tribute to their love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Construction took over 20 years, involving thousands of artisans, architects, and laborers. It was completed in 1653, with materials sourced from across the vast Mughal Empire and beyond, including white marble from Rajasthan and precious stones from Persia, Tibet, and China.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Architectural Marvel
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Taj Mahal is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, blending elements of Persian, Indian, and Islamic design. The central structure, made of pristine white marble, is crowned by a magnificent dome that rises 73 meters (240 feet) into the sky. Four slender minarets stand at each corner, subtly angled outward to protect the tomb in case of earthquakes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Intricate floral designs and calligraphy adorn the walls, created using inlay work with semi-precious stones such as jade, turquoise, and lapis lazuli. The interior houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, while their actual tombs rest in a lower chamber, in accordance with Islamic tradition.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Taj Mahal is set within a sprawling Mughal garden, designed to represent paradise on earth. Its symmetrical layout features fountains, reflecting pools, and pathways that enhance the monument’s ethereal beauty, especially during sunrise and sunset when the marble changes hues with the light.
  </p>

    Over the centuries, the Taj Mahal has faced challenges from pollution and environmental changes, but restoration efforts have ensured its preservation as a global treasure.
